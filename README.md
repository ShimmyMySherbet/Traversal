# Traversal
Allows for character data to be stored in a MySQL database, allowing for corss-server character syncing. 

This plugin was originally going to be a paid plugin released on <a href="https://imperialplugins.com">ImperialPlugins.com</a>, however, I never ended up giving it all the spit and polish I wanted to. And 2 years later I rediscovered this project operational but unreleased, so I decided to just release it for free.

## Features

Control what specifically syncs and between what servers. 

This allows you to sync:
* Player inventory data
* Player clothing
* Player experience
* Player vitals (health, hunger, ect.)
* Player quest flags (allowing for cross-server quests)
* Player Skills
